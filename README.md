# Handwritten-Greek-Character-Recognition

This dissertation explores the fascinating realm of handwritten Greek character recognition, focusing on creating effective models for accurate identification. The goal is to overcome the unique challenges presented by different writing styles, sizes, and contextual variations.
Two distinct datasets, the Greek Handwritten Characters Classification dataset and the Greek Character Database (GCDB) dataset, are used as the foundation. The datasets are carefully prepared through steps like dimensionality reduction and data organization, followed by a close look at the data's characteristics to make informed choices.
The study covers various recognition techniques, starting with basic methods like k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Decision Trees, built from scratch. These serve as starting points for comparison. The Random Forest algorithm is then introduced, combining decision trees for better accuracy.
To propel recognition capabilities even further, the realm of deep learning is harnessed. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) take centre stage, explored through the lenses of popular frameworks like TensorFlow. Elaborate insights into these frameworks' mechanics, coupled with effective network design strategies, are meticulously expounded.
Performance evaluation encompasses comprehensive measures, with a focus on confusion matrix-based class-wise accuracy assessment. This method encapsulates the models' performance across different classes, offering a nuanced perspective. Simulated real-world scenarios gauge the models' practical utility, while comparative analysis against existing models underscores the progress achieved.
In culmination, this dissertation not only propels the frontier of handwritten Greek character recognition but also furnishes practical understandings of varied recognition techniques.
